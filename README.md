This project provides a basic Student Database Management application built with the Go Fiber web framework and PostgreSQL as the database.

Features:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for students.
RESTful API for managing student data.
Requirements:

GoLang (version 1.18 or higher recommended)
PostgreSQL database server
Fiber CLI (fiber install --global)
Setup:

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://your-repository-link.git
cd student-database-management
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Configure database connection:
Create a PostgreSQL database and user.
Modify the database/database.go file (replace placeholders with your actual credentials):
Go
package database

import (
  "github.com/go-sql-driver/postgres"
)

var DB *postgres.DB

func Connect() error {
  // Replace with your database connection details
  conn, err := postgres.Connect(&postgres.Config{
    User:     "your_username",
    Password: "your_password",
    Host:     "localhost",
    Port:     5432,
    Database: "your_database_name",
  })
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  DB = conn
  return nil
}
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Run the application:
Bash
go run main.go
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can change the port in the main.go file.

Usage:

The application provides a RESTful API for CRUD operations on students. Here are some examples using curl:

Get all students:

Bash
curl http://localhost:8080/students
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Create a new student:

Bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "grade": 10}' http://localhost:3000/students
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Get a student by ID:

Bash
curl http://localhost:8080/students/1
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Update a student:

Bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jane Doe", "grade": 11}' http://localhost:3000/students/1
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Delete a student:

Bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/students/1
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Note:

This is a basic example and can be extended to include functionalities like student authentication, authorization, and more comprehensive error handling.
Consider implementing data validation for student information to ensure data integrity.
